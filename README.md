## Atac bus position open data ingestion system

Project based on [this](https://github.com/LSparkzwz/atac-roma-open-data-ingestion-system), except it gets the position of every bus currently working in Rome, their route and next stop.
This project uses AWS Lambda, Athena and S3 in order to obtain the data.

I don't plan to keep working on this project.
